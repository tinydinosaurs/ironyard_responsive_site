# responsive

This is day 4 homeworks. It includes some pretty drawings in the img folder. Ok, they're actually the scribblings of an insane person, but feel free to enjoy them all the same.

Eventually there will also be a responsive site in this repo with an associated sass file.

Because stuff and things.
